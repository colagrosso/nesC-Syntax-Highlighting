h3. nesC Syntax Highlighting for TextMate and SubEthaEdit

When I programmed in "nesC":http://nescc.sourceforge.net/ for "TinyOS":http://www.tinyos.net/, I made a SubEthaEdit mode and a TextMate bundle to do syntax highlighting. Then I forgot about them. Then "someone asked about them":http://www.flickr.com/photos/mikecolagrosso/220431799/, so I made them available here.
